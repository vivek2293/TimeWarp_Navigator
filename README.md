I created this project while learning JavaScript. By this project, I came to know how we can use JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS to give our webpage interactive view without the need of a server as all the script is executed by the Browser on the Client-Side.

It was a very helpful beginner-level project to get an idea about how JavaScript is used along with HTML and CSS. It was an amazing experience.
